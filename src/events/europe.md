## What is Qiskit Camp?

Qiskit Camp brings together the quantum community for an immersive experience consisting of training sessions, deep technical talks, and a hackathon with the Qiskit core development team. Learn about new updates to Qiskit and meet the people building it.

The 2019 Qiskit Camp Europe will be hosted near Zurich, Switzerland from September 12-15. Invitations will be distributed prior to the event.

## Locations

Qiskit Camp Europe will make history as the first hackathon to ever take place at the Piz Gloria, a revolving restaurant at the top of Schilthorn Peak in Switzerland. Piz Gloria was originally made famous for being Blofeld's clinical facility in the James Bond movie [On Her Majesty's Secret Service](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064757/).

Attendees will have accomodations in the scenic town of MÃ¼rren, a short gondola ride from the Piz Gloria.

    Metal helps bridges the world of classical electronic design automation (EDA) and electromagnetic simulation tools with that of quantum analysis.
    Metal defines the abstraction of a quantum device design, needed for closed-loop optimization between design & analysis. Over time, our vision is to also develop metal to be usable by a front-end user with little to no programming knowledge, using available libraries of quantum components & renderers.`,

    description: 'Metal is designed with the vision to seamlessly automate classical and quantum analysis. Choose from a list of available tools or connect your own through a flexible plug-in interface that allows you to orchestrate device design from within Metal. When you are ready, with the click of a button, export the design for fabrication, and you are done.',

    title: 'Flexible & extensible',
    description: `Flexible interface: GUI view, Jupyter notebook view, Simulator view, Physical output view.

    Extensible: User-friendly python API and library of tools allow you to define your own custom quantum components.
    
    Co-development: Linked with leading simulation and export/import interoperability with commercial-tool backends.`,

    title: 'Integrated functionality',
    description: `All-in-one platform powerful programming paradigm to unify design, simulation, and quantum analysis. 
    Metal helps bridges the world of classical electronic design automation (EDA) and electromagnetic simulation tools with that of quantum analysis.
    Metal defines the abstraction of a quantum device design, needed for closed-loop optimization between design & analysis. Over time, our vision is to also develop metal to be usable by a front-end user with little to no programming knowledge, using available libraries of quantum components & renderers.`,

  The summer school is made up of a total of 20 lectures, 5 lab sessions & application exercises, in addition to the daily Live Q&A Sessions and final Commencement Celebration. Participation and completion of all labs and lectures are required in order to receive a certificate of completion from the Summer School, with the optional Q&A Sessions and Commencement activities to enhance your Summer School experience. The schedule is not fixed, aside from final lab submission deadlines, and all students can participate on the schedule that works best for them. Students should anticipate a minimum time commitment of 30 hours for the full Summer School, but we recommend planning on 41 hours of participation, with additional time for discussion and collaboration with other students.

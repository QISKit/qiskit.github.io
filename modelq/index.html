		<div>At long last, we are thrilled to unveil the new portable Model Q Composer Keyboard: the optimal companion for the serious quantum programmer.</div>
		<div>"No other device on the market offers the flexibility and convenience of the Model Q for quantum programming," said Jay Gambetta, theorist and enthusiastic button-pusher. "What would take me years to develop can now be accomplished in a week...and I no longer suffer from Programmer's Finger Fatigue Syndrome.”

		<div>Its clean design and colorful keys finally fill the need our QISKit users have been clamoring for. You can compose a circuit effortlessly and one-handedly.  Featuring the same highly-acclaimed buckling spring action first seen on the legendary IBM Model M, the keys are specially engineered for high-speed composing with low actuation force, yet with mind-blowing rebound speeds and deep strokes to ensure no unintentional entanglement -- of qubits OR of fingers! You will be churning out quantum scores in no time.

		<div>Reviews 


"The Model M revolutionized classical programming, and the Model Q is bound to do the same for quantum.  The Model Q Quantum Keyboard is the must-have accessory for any serious QISKitter. I particularly appreciate the tactile and auditory feedback it provides."  Lev D. Bishop

"It’s amazing! The keys create the physical entanglement between Q-chip and me. I love the feature of assigning a waveform sound to every interaction -- it’s like playing a Q-piano. Every second that I use it, my brain enters into a superposition state.”   Ismael C. Faro, IBM Q developer team
"We’ve been working on this in the laboratory for the past year. It’s taken several prototypes to get the color scheme just right. The first few put some programmers in the hospital, but we’ve worked out all those bugs.” David R. McKay, technical lead of keyboard development and engineering 
"Using the Model Q Quantum Keyboard always leaves me in an excited state! Its ergonomic design allows your hand to rest in a superb-position, and it feels as if you could almost touch the qubits. It’s so cool!” Lead QISKit Developer Diego E. Moreda
"It's greatly improved the quality of my daily calibration runs.” - Sarah D. Sheldon, qubit calibration engineer
"I am no longer confused about quantum programming!  Now it's child's play.”  - Jerry I. Chow, head of quantum development
"I like the colors and its developer console.” - Remarked Dr. Chris T. Wood, PhD.

      "architectureDescription": "Qiskit is an open source framework for quantum computing whose goal is to be accessible to people with many backgrounds: quantum researchers, other scientists, teachers, developers, and general tech enthusiasts. Our vision for Qiskit consists of four foundational elements: Terra (the code foundation, for composing quantum programs at the level of circuits and pulses), Aqua (for building algorithms and applications), Ignis (for addressing noise and errors), and Aer (for accelerating development via simulators, emulators and debuggers). Today, we bring you Terra and Acqua, and a commitment to deliver Ignis and Aer in the near future.",

Within Terra is a set of tools for composing quantum programs at the level of circuits and pulses, optimizing them for the constraints of a particular physical quantum processor, and managing the batched execution of experiments on remote-access backends. Terra is modularly constructed, simplifying the addition of extensions for circuit optimizations and backends. We welcome your contributions!",

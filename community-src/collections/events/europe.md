## What is Qiskit Camp?

Qiskit Camp brings together the quantum community for an immersive three days of training sessions, deep technical talks, and a hackathon with the Qiskit core development team. Learn about new updates to Qiskit and meet the people building it.

Taking place before the annual APS 2019 meeting, the invite-only experience includes a one-day conference at IBM Q research headquarters before embarking to a mountain resort where we will host a 24-hour hackathon competition in a barn, enjoy winter campfires, and many other surprises!

Transportation, accommodation\*, entertainment and food is included.

<p class="clarification">
*The Mountain Top Inn & Resort consists of cabins where hackathon team members can opt in to be co-located in shared cabin space with priority given to students or others needing travel assistance. A limited number of individual accommodations will be available, so we ask that you make your own bookings if that is preferred.

Not yet a Qiskit contributor? There are some things you can start doing now: write a blog, create a tutorial, fix an issue, make a video, teach Qiskitâ€¦

## Get ready for the Qiskit Hackathon!

Qiskit Hackathon starts soon and you should be ready for participating. Save time and read this preparation guide beforehand so you can make the most of your time at Qiskit Camp.

### Training sessions

Since you'll be contributing to Qiskit in a 24-hour hackathon, we recommend that you attend the training sessions in the track 1 on February 26. If you feel confident enough about your programming skills or want to delve into more advanced topics, we have prepared an unconference space.

### What is an unconference?

An unconference is a participant-driven meeting. You decide the agenda by proposing and voting relevant topics. In case you're shy, we have prepared some topics in advance such as transpiler & template optimization, simulators, pulses or noise measurement.

## What is the Qiskit Global Summer School?
Qiskit Global Summer School is a two-week intensive summer school designed to empower the next generation of quantum developers with the knowledge to explore quantum applications on their own. The curriculum covers quantum computing preliminaries before focusing on two key areas: **superconducting devices** and **quantum chemistry applications**.

The Qiskit Global Summer School is based on premium training provided to our IBM Quantum interns. We are incredibly excited to make this educational opportunity open to a broad audience. The lectures of the Qiskit Global Summer School will be thorough, and our team of quantum computing experts with extensive teaching experience will cover all steps of the calculations.


## Prerequisites
Minimal prerequisites are required for the Qiskit Global Summer School. If you know [how to multiply two matrices](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/x9e81a4f98389efdf:matrices/x9e81a4f98389efdf:multiplying-matrices-by-matrices/v/matrix-multiplication-intro), and have some programming experience in Python, you are ready for the Qiskit Global Summer School.

You can [brush up on Python programming](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-prerequisites/python-and-jupyter-notebooks.html) before attending the lectures by using the Qiskit Textbook. To make the most out of these lectures, you may also consider looking through the [linear algebra prerequisites](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-prerequisites/linear_algebra.html) section of the Qiskit Textbook.


## Curriculum
Each day of the Qiskit Global Summer School consists of 3 hours of lectures followed by an hour-long hands-on programming lab where we implement quantum programs in Qiskit.

### Lecture 1
**Qubits and Quantum States, Quantum Circuits, Measurements**\

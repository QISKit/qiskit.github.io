Is a Dungeons and Dragons style dice roller a good use of a quantum computer? I sure think so.

Computers as we know them (aka classical computers) can, at best, generate pseudo-random numbers. Quantum computers, using uniquely quantum properties, can generate truly random numbers. This project uses random numbers generated from IBM Q's quantum systems to provide a random sequence for a simple dice rolling app.

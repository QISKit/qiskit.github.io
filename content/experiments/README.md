# How to publish your project

1. Clone this repository (https://github.com/qiskit-community/community.qiskit.org)
2. Choose an easy to write name for your folder (lowercase), for example, if your project is called: "Using Groover with RSA", make a folder called groover-rsa, remember it as [your_project_name]
3. If you have images add them to a folder inside /static/images/experiments/[your_project_name]
4. Go to /content/experiments/ and create a new card by creating a [your_project_name].md file
5. Use the template from any of the existing experiments and point to your sources, images and description.
6. Contact us to merge it and we can add it then to the main experiments webpage.

Enjoy and keep hacking with Qiskit!

Contributor License Agreement
-----------------------------

We'd love to accept your code! Before we can, we have to get a few legal
requirements sorted out. By signing a contributor license agreement (CLA), we
ensure that the community is free to use your contributions.

When you contribute to the Qiskit Terra project with a new pull request, a bot will
evaluate whether you have signed the CLA. If required, the bot will comment on
the pull request,  including a link to accept the agreement. The
`individual CLA <https://qiskit.org/license/qiskit-cla.pdf>`_ document is
available for review as a PDF.

NOTE: If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,
then you'll need to sign a `corporate CLA <https://qiskit.org/license/qiskit-corporate-cla.pdf>`_
and email it to us at qiskit@us.ibm.com.

Open Source Quantum Information Software Kit

The Open Source Quantum Information Software Kit (QISKit for short) is a software development kit (SDK) for working with OpenQASM and the IBM Q experience (QX) quantum processors. 

Use QISKit to create quantum computing programs, compile them, and execute them on one of several backends (online Real quantum processors, and simulators).
